# Summarizing-personalised-social-biases-towards-Indian-states-using-LLMs
**Overview**

This project aims to analyze and summarize state-wise social biases in India using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging Reddit, Quora, and YouTube data, we extract and analyze public sentiments, classify them, and summarize biases using different LLMs. The goal is to create a dataset that captures state-specific biases and evaluate various LLMs' ability to summarize these biases accurately.
